            </div>


            <h2 id="inkling-intro" class="project_header">Intro</h2>
            <p>Throughout my 10 week Interaction Design class, I learned the <b>importance of microinteractions</b> supported by triggers, feedback, rules and modes and applied this knowledge to <b>rebrand an app with newly imagined interactions</b>.</p>
            <p><i>As a result, I gained a better understanding of how <b>interaction design contributes to making products that understand people</b>, increasing my interest towards creating immersive products.</i></p>


            <h2 id="inkling-the-user" class="project_header">The User</h2>
            <p>First, this redesign and rebranding process began with <b>choosing an app with a singular focus</b> and researching its target user.</p>
            <p><i>Waffle, now reimagined into <b>Inkling</b>, is a <b>group journaling app</b> for couples, family and friends <b>to collaborate and write journal entries together</b>.</i></p>
            <img alt="Inkling cover" src="images/Inkling-User-Sammy.webp" class="rounded-image"/>
            <ul><li>Since <b>Inkling targets youth and college-age adults</b> to create shared journals, this is where Sammy comes in. As a college freshman seeking to keep friendships from high school strong, Sammy is a perfect match.</li></ul>
            
            <h2 id="inkling-process" class="project_header">Process</h2>
            <p>In order to reimagine the app's common user flow of opening the app and creating and posting a new journal entry, I started with <b>sketches</b> for possible microinteractions to explore in my final demonstration.</p>
            <p><i><b>What is the personality of my brand, and how did I want it to move at different touch points?</b></i></p>
            
            <div class="image-grid">
                <div class="image-row">

            <p><b>From my wireflow to IX Flow</b>, Inkling's <b>UI design</b> and its <b>user journey changed over time</b>.</p>
            
            <p>I <b>simplified the user flow to four tasks</b> and <b>experimented</b> with different depictions for the app's UI elements.</p>
            
            <p>In the high fidelity IX flow featured below I made sure to provide the feedback the app gives whenever the user presses the screen.</p>

            <img src="images/Inkling-High-Fidelity-IX-Flow.webp" alt="Inkling high fidelity ix flow" class="rounded-image">


            <p>While <b>rebranding</b>, I placed a focus on <b>dark gray</b> and <b>light teal</b> to create a minimal, sleek <b>impression</b> that still felt <b>calming for the user</b> to enter. With dark mode creating a tranquil space, <b>users are encouraged to spill their thoughts freely</b>.</p>
            
            <p>With my high fidelity UI design settled, I moved on to establishing the microinteractions I would animate by <b>creating an interaction guide</b>. This would make it clearer when creating translated keyframes in After Effects.</p>

            <p><b>Interactions I placed a heavy focus on were ones that involved the core purpose of the app.</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li>For example, <b>to symbolize the excitement</b> that comes <b>from a new idea</b> or the frenzied feeling of wanting to jot feelings out quickly to paper, the <b>button</b> for making new journal entries displayed a <b>feather pen scribbling</b> out some writing <b>after being pressed</b>.</li>
                <li><i>While it's a small moment that is easy to disregard, it helps establish the character of the app, <b>making it easier for the user to feel connected to it</b>.</i></li>
            </ul>
            
            <img src="images/Inkling-Interaction-Guides.webp" alt="Inkling interaction guides" class="rounded-image">

            <p>Moving on to <b>After Effects</b>, I was <b>determined to create</b> a smooth depiction of a user interacting with the app that showcased its <b>subtle microinteractions</b>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Considering the timing, <b>how could I quickly communicate</b> what happens when the user opens a journal to access their entries? From start to finish, I wanted to ensure the <b>feedback</b> from the app was <b>as clear and non intrusive</b> as possible—in a way that still felt helpful—<b>to the user</b>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="inkling-reflection" class="project_header">Reflection</h2>
                <p>Looking back, I'm proud of the microinteractions I animated in my <b>first use of After Effects</b>.</p>
                <p>Timing the interactions that have the most attention became essential, and I focused quite a bit on the app's loading screen as well as the success notification from posting an entry as an example.</p>
                <p><b>I still would improve the flow of some interactions</b> however if I was given more time. Less class time was spent working in After Effects than I anticipated, creating some speediness in the responsiveness of the app in the beginning of the video where the user navigates through the journals. </p>
                <p>As a result, <b>I can see the importance of timing much better now in presenting realistic user flows</b>. With this in mind, I'm motivated to improve on my interaction design skills through more After Effects projects in the future!</p>
