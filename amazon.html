                            I learned how many environments a delivery person navigates in one day. As drivers are encouraged to deliver packages quickly, <b>mistakes</b> can happen, which <b>are not the fault of the driver</b>.

                        Throughout this process, <b>engaging in Crazy Eights</b>, an ideation practice where you create 8 designs in 8 minutes, helped greatly. Moreover, <b>starting with paper</b> helped the idea process feel more organic.

                    </p>
                    <p>As my confidence grew in the final weeks, I had the opportunity to attend a <b>company offsite in Seattle</b>, and to give my final presentation in-person while I was there <b>(nervewracking, but exciting and worth it!)</b>. I met my coworkers in person, connected with some awesome designers, and participated in engaging UXD, UXR &amp; soft skills training workshops.</p>
                    <p><b>Why I'm Excited About UX</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collaborative design thinking is deeply rewarding</li>
                        <li>
                            Many opportunities to research customer needs</li>
                        <li>Developing a business acumen helps create impactful experiences</li>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>As a result of this internship, I am even more excited to pursue UX. Going forward, I aim to <b>refine my approach to making trade-offs</b> in design projects and to better engage with business goals. In the meantime, I'm <b>eager to elevate my skills</b> through my studies and actively pursue UX learning opportunities whenever possible!</p>
