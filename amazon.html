                        Over the course of 13 weeks, I redesigned delivery instructions as part of the Delivery Experience team at Amazon.

As a result, I contributed valuable insights for my team to improve the experience between customers and drivers.

                            After talking to parents in Philadelphia and utilizing our team's own connections to middle schools in the area, we realized a bigger need to connect free after-school programs with <b>working parents</b>, who often <b>do not have the means to pay high program fees</b>.

                        What I learned from this project
                    </h2>
                        <p>Despite the efforts I placed in this project, <b>I feel more could be done to solve this problem</b>. At week 9 of the design process, I <b>presented my work to industry professionals at Comcast</b> as part of my internship program in order to receive critiques. <b>The advice I received</b> back was not only kind but also <b>very insightful</b> in ways I could have expanded on my design.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The explore page could have been improved on through lists rather than a grid system of cards, by additional filters, as well as a map showing parents visually where programs are located. </li>
                            <li>I was also <b>urged to consider creating a page of additional resources</b> to connect parents to more program finders, as well as grants and scholarships.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Gaining perspective from experts helped extremely</b>, making me wish I had met with them earlier in the design process. Although this was my first internship, <b>I should have asked more questions</b> early in the process to create a more informed design. </p>
                        <p>If anything, this experience has taught me that <b>the most successful products are the ones that connect people</b>, and that that is done well by talking extensively with the people who are affected by the issue. Now more than ever I am excited by UX research and how it works to create interfaces that understand their users.</p>
