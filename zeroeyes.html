                        <p>As part of a tech company composed of army veterans and others with like-minded ambition, my workload consisted of creating design assets to communicate the brand identity of the company. Different opportunities existed in every corner to practice my design skills and improve the existing branding.

                            Throughout the internship, as part of the Marketing team I collaborated with the VP of marketing, Director of Content, VP of Partnerships, and Director of Partnerships to deliver impactful designs.

                        <p>While working on social media posts, flyers and promotions for their ongoing <b>No Bell </b>podcast, I grew to understand the outward facing personality of ZeroEyes, which provides a cutting edge product and is bold in its communication.

                        <p>Using Canva, the most used design tool by the team, I created an internal branding guide to be used by the marketing team for reference creating files in the future. 
                        </p>

                        <p>In it, I communicated existing logos, fonts, colors, images, image treatments, graphics and other design expectations for the brand. I was also given the chance to propose alternative fonts, create an icon set, a photo library and new graphics for all marketing materials. 
                        </p>

                        <p>Using Figma, and adhering to feedback from my manager, I created an icon set that was sharp and compact, highlighting the modern aesthetic of ZeroEyes. For the image library, I acquired images online and followed existing guidelines for image treatments to make it easier for the team to have images to pull from in the future.

                            Meeting frequently with the partnership and research team, I created wireframes balancing technology needs and the business goals of the project. I would ask, is this information correct, and are there suggestions for the layout? Can this be done and does it make sense to?
