                    <p>
                        After talking to parents in Philadelphia and utilizing our team's own connections to middle schools in the area, we realized a bigger need to connect free after-school programs with <b>working parents</b>, who often <b>do not have the means to pay high program fees</b>.

                        <p>Despite the efforts I placed in this project, <b>I feel more could be done to solve this problem</b>. At week 9 of the design process, I <b>presented my work to industry professionals at Comcast</b> as part of my internship program in order to receive critiques. <b>The advice I received</b> back was not only kind but also <b>very insightful</b> in ways I could have expanded on my design.</p>

                            <li>The explore page could have been improved on through lists rather than a grid system of cards, by additional filters, as well as a map showing parents visually where programs are located. </li>
                            <li>I was also <b>urged to consider creating a page of additional resources</b> to connect parents to more program finders, as well as grants and scholarships.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Gaining perspective from experts helped extremely</b>, making me wish I had met with them earlier in the design process. Although this was my first internship, <b>I should have asked more questions</b> early in the process to create a more informed design. </p>
                        <p>If anything, this experience has taught me that <b>the most successful products are the ones that connect people</b>, and that that is done well by talking extensively with the people who are affected by the issue. Now more than ever I am excited by UX research and how it works to create interfaces that understand their users.</p>
