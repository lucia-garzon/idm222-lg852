                <h2 class="project_header">Intro</h2>
                    <p>Together, me and my team noticed and capitalized on a need to connect <b>parents in Philadelphia</b> with <b>accessible after-school programs</b> to keep their children safe from violence.</p>
                    
                    <!-- DONE desk research image -->
                    <img alt="PhillyReach Desk Research" class="rounded-image" src="images/PhillyReach-Desk-Research.webp"> 

                    <p>The solution that we came up with is <b>PhillyReach</b>, <b>a program-finding desktop website for working parents in Philadelphia</b>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As our product seeks to help low to middle-income parents <b>find affordable programs</b> efficiently, PhillyReach offers a wide variety of educational programs available <b>for middle-grade youth in Philadelphia</b>.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <h2>Process</h2>

                <h3 class="project1-header">Discover</h3>
                    <p>First, I engaged in desk and user research with my team to better identify our problem. <b>What solutions exist</b> to solve this need, <b>and how can they be better accessed</b>?</p>
                    
                    <!-- DONE user research image  -->
                    <img alt="Phillyreach user research" class="rounded-image" src="images/PhillyReach-User-Research.webp">
                    <ul><li>There are multiple non-profit organization websites that list their educational programs in Philadelphia as well as a <a href="https://www.phila.gov/ost/program-locator/#/" target="_blank"><b>government website</b> that acts as a database</a> for after-school care in the city.</li></ul>

                    <p>However, <b>parents complain</b> these <b>program-finding websites aren't organized</b> and streamlined enough for them to find the right program that fits their child's needs and interests.</p>

                    <p>After talking to parents in Philadelphia and utilizing our team's own connections to middle schools in the area, we realized a bigger need to connect free after-school programs with <b>working parents</b>, who often <b>do not have the means to pay high program fees</b>.</p>

                    <!-- DONE laura user persona image -->
                    <img alt="Phillyreach user persona" class="rounded-image" src="images/PhillyReach-Laura.webp">

                    <p>This is demonstrated with Laura, our user persona who is a single working mother <b>struggling</b> from a lack of free time and <b>scattered resources</b> for support.</p>

                <h3 class="project_header">Define</h3>
                    <p> Recognizing the scarcity of resources catering to <b>Philadelphia's youth</b>, who are often <b>vulnerable</b> to crime after school, we were driven to develop a website that addresses this need for the <b>hardworking parents</b> in Philadelphia, who <b>need a safe place for their kids</b> to stay after school that comes <b>with enriching educational opportunities</b>.</p>

                    <!-- DONE ideation image -->
                    <img alt="Phillyreach ideation" class="rounded-image" src="images/PhillyReach-Ideation.webp">
                    <p>When <b>ideating</b> core features of our website, we knew we wanted a search bar and filtering system to <b>provide opportunities</b> for youth in Philly. </p>

                <h3 class="project_header">Develop &amp; Deliver</h3>
                    <p>Our proposed solution to this problem, <b>PhillyReach</b>, is a centralized program-finding website that allows parents to utilize a <b>search bar</b> and <b>filtering system</b> to navigate through affordable after-school care. </p>

                    <!-- DONE phillyreach 2 screens MAY BE PIXELATED -->
                    <img alt="Phillyreach two screens" class="rounded-image" src="images/PhillyReach-2-screens.webp">

                    <ul>
                        <li>From the search bar on our Home page, parents are directed to the <b>Explore page</b> containing a <b>database of programs in Philly</b>.</li>
                        <li>Parents can freely explore the program profiles and be taken to a <b>direct link</b> to sign up once they click a card they are interested in.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Overall, they can also <b>expand on their searching</b> through the search bar on the Explore page, or the <b>two filter options provided</b> which customize programs based on the <b>interest</b> or focus area of a program, as well as how far a program is to a parent's <b>zip code</b>.</p>

                    <img alt="Phillyreach image filtering" class="rounded-image" src="images/Phillyreach-filtering-system.webp">
                    <ul><li><i><b>Why did I choose to filter this way?</b></i> Two common factors <b>a parent considers</b> when searching for a program is <b>how far it is</b> from them, and <b>what interest areas it provides</b> to enrich their kids, whether it's STEM and sports, to art and mentorship opportunities.</li></ul>

                    <!-- DONE style guide image -->
                    <img alt="Phillyreach style guide" class="rounded-image" src="images/Phillyreach-styling-updated.webp">
                    <ul>
                        <li>While designing this website, <b>I wanted parents to understand quickly</b> the type of services we provide. I placed a focus on light blue and white in our branding to create a modern look and feel. </li>
                        <li><b>Blue</b> in particular is <b>used in many educational websites</b>, which is why it's the main color of PhillyReach, and a prominent color explored in my Figma color styles. </li>
                        <li>I also <b>customized the website through vectors</b> I personally made of the city's famous icons, from the Rocky statue and the Liberty Bell to the Ben Franklin Bridge.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- buttons image, should i still put this -->
                    <ul><li>I placed a <b>focus on ease of use and accessibility</b> on the website by taking into consideration the website's fonts and font sizes, color contrast, button sizes, as well as <b>following a grid system</b> in the explore page. This culminated in a consistent, sleek design.</li></ul>

                    <p>From my wireframes to the final mock-up, I iteratively created an experience that would lessen the steps parents in Philly often take to find programs. <b>With just two clicks</b>, <b>a parent can find a program and sign up for it</b> through the organization website.</p>

                    <p>With <b>Figma smart animate</b>, I was able to enhance the user's journey by creating quick interactions that appear smoothly when the user hovers over buttons and program cards, and encourages them to explore the website further.</p>

                <h2 class="project1-reflection">Reflection</h2>
                    <p>Despite the efforts I placed in this project, <b>I feel more could be done to solve this problem</b>. At week 9 of the design process, I <b>presented my work to industry professionals at Comcast</b> as part of my internship program in order to receive critiques. <b>The advice I received</b> back was not only kind but also <b>very insightful</b> in ways I could have expanded on my design.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The explore page could have been improved on through lists rather than a grid system of cards, by additional filters, as well as a map showing parents visually where programs are located. </li>
                        <li>I was also <b>urged to consider creating a page of additional resources</b> to connect parents to more program finders, as well as grants and scholarships.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Gaining perspective from experts helped extremely</b>, making me wish I had met with them earlier in the design process. Although this was my first internship, <b>I should have asked more questions</b> early in the process to create a more informed design. </p>
                    <p>If anything, this experience has taught me that <b>the most successful products are the ones that connect people</b>, and that that is done well by talking extensively with the people who are affected by the issue. Now more than ever I am excited by UX research and how it works to create interfaces that understand their users.</p>
